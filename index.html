                    <p>Being a System's Design Engineering student, I am taught intensively to think about solving big problems. To design solutions, I enjoy executing design sprints to understand the problem, the users, and to creatively ideate design concepts.</p>

                      <p>I think this is the most important skill that anybody can have; the ability to play super hard! The more we see our work as a game, the more we can begin to think creatively and less stressfully about the task, and that's why I try my best to have fun with everything I do.</p>

Our team of 6 members were tasked to design an application that presents useful information drived by the Watson Analytics API.

                            <h3>My Role</h3>
                            <p>The team of 6 members consisted of front end developers, back end developers, business oriented members, and two UI/UX designers - one of which was me! My focus for this project was to design the mobile application interface with requirements that were discussed by the whole team collaboratively.</p>
                            <br>

                            <h3>Problem Space</h3>
                            <small>Frusturations in online shopping.</small>
                            <p>Shopping becomes super frusturating when you've scanned through 20 pages of an online store and you haven't come across a single product that tickles your interest. After that, the only thing that might be felt if regret, especially when you probabaly should've been getting other important work done in this time and online shopping was only suppose to be a quick source of happiness!</p>
                            <br>

                            <h3>Research</h3>
                            <small>Why is it frusturating?</small>
                            <p>With online shoppers within our project team itself, the research subjects were easy to obtain. We analyzed team members as they searched their favourite online stores with a "think aloud" approach. As a result, we were able to identify the pain points during the process:
                              <ul>
                                <li>On average, user was interested in a product after searching three pages of items.</li>
                                <li>User feel that majority of the products perform poorly at aiming to their unique personalities.</li>
                                <li>Time taken to find a product exceeds the time that the user allocated for their shopping visit.</li>
                                <li>Some users never even found a prodct that they liked during their recorded shopping trip.</li>
                              </ul>
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h3>Persona</h3>
                            <small>Creating a fake user to help us better understand who to design for.</small>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/iBuyer/persona.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <br>

                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            <small>A Store Just for the User.</small>
                            <p>We built a shopping application that performs deep learnig on each unique user. By collecting data from certain activities in the user's social media, Watson Analytics is able to analyze this data and determine the user's interests in a few different categories: Sports, Movies, Health, and Education. More specificly, each of these categories can be taken a step deeper by the user to see which of their activties in the past have impacted their persoanlity results. The result of this is an online store that collects catered products from multiple vendors into one place. This saves time from browsing through countless pages, and highly improves the success of the mobile shopping visit.</p>

Adminitngly, I felt that my core values were weaked during tough times filled with failure. Although difficult, I also feel that I was able to recover my strengths, and when I did, I wanted to asure myself that I train myself to never think doubtedly again. With the purpose to communicate the deeper values of fitness, I teamed with a friend who holds a similar mindset to establish a brand with a unique identity that strives for self-improvement amoung failures.</p>

                            <h3>The Vision</h3>
                            <p>The aim of this project is to convince individuals that failure is not a bad thing. We set to accomplish this by constructing a brand that is chracterized by power, strength, will, and more importantly that any other trait, the brand is characterised by failures. As a beginning step, we thought about Batman; a hero characterised with strengths that were build by his many downfalls. This type of literature seen in Batman can be looked at as a role model for Evolv. </p>

                            <h3>Logo Design</h3>
                            <p>Believe me, there were hundreds of sketches before I came up with these.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/evolv/logos.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <br>

                            <h3>Product Design</h3>
                            <p>Using blank t-shirt templates, we fombled with various tshirt designs on Photoshop. Eventually, we came up with something like this.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/evolv/productDesign.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <br>

                            <h3>Personalized Touch</h3>
                            <p>Since this brand focuses on a very deep level with the user, namely their personal performance and development, I felt that it was almost mandatory to make users feel significant. Every package holds a message personalized to the user.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/evolv/personalization.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <br>

                            <h3>Packaging Experience</h3>
                            <p>My biggest focus was to make every part of this brand memorable, and I acheived this by making the little things stand out. The first impression of a product is made during the unpackaging of the product. We felt that it was important to get this part right, so we designed product packaging that stood out from other fitness clothing retailors.</p>

                            <h3>Landing Page</h3>
                            <p>The online store for Evolv Fit Wear. One of the challenges I had with creating the design for this page was that we started off with selling only three items. As a result, following a standard online store design with a separate products page wouldn't work for us. So, I made the landing page itself more dominant with the content, and now the user can browse all items with minimal navigation steps. Also, a cool way we presented our products was by making each of them a segment of a journey. One product represents the beginning of a journey, the failure. Another product represents the training phase, where work is put in to correct the failures. And last but not least, our third product symbolizes success and evolution. The designs also resemble these aspects.</p>

                            <h3>My Role</h3>
                            <p>As the lead designer for daVinci, I was tasked to design the Next Generation Assortment Planning tool as the company transitioned from downloadable software to creating their software as a web application. Aside from the assortment planning, I also designed the company's ticketing system where customers can report issues with their product.</p>
                            <br>

                            <h3>The Client</h3>
                            <p>One of the big challenges I faced was that I had to design one application for various clients with different needs. In other words, I was not always given a clear set of user requirements. The user requirements could rather be considered a "dynamic variable" in this case. My approach to this challenge was to design the application as customizable as possible. The user is given a standard view, but has the option to customize parts of the application to suit their own process.</p>
                            <br>

                            <h3>Mockups/Prototypes</h3>
                            <p>I started by presenting a few different layout formats to the business team. Preference was given to the "Master-Detail" layout pattern. This pattern consists of a main area, the Master area, where an overview of all data items are viewed. To view deeper level information for a specific item in the Master area, a Detail panel presents details for the selected item. The Master-Detail is a great design pattern for the Merchandise Planning application because it provides an efficient way to navigate large data sets. At any given time, the screen space is only populated with the information that the user is interested in. As a result, scanability is improved, as well as the user's ability to focus on their areas of interest.</p>

                            <h3>Flow Chart</h3>
                            <p>The flow chart describes the usage and outcomes for each functionality on the user interface. This planning application is very complex and entails a large number of functions. For such a case, a separate flow chart was created for each screen of the application. This allows cleaninless and better readibility of the context. Below is just one flowchart for the home screen of the application.</p>

                            <h3>Final Design</h3>
                            <p>Although no design is final due to constant changes in user needs, we can temporarily call this the final design. Hooray for the iterative design process!</p>
