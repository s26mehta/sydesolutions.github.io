                      <p>I think this is the most important skill that anybody can have; the ability to play super hard! The more we see our work as a game, the more we can begin to think creatively and less stressfully about the task, and that's why I try my best to have fun with everything I do.</p>

Our team of 6 members were tasked to design an application that presents useful information drived by the Watson Analytics API. Watson Analytics is a smart data discovery service available on the cloud that guides data exploration, automates predictive analytics and enables efortless dashboard and infographic creation. Using the data served by this intelligent tool, we are better able to make confident decisons regarding a set of data.</p>

                            <h3>My Role</h3>
                            <p>The team of 6 members consisted of front end developers, back end developers, business oriented members, and two UI/UX designers - one of which was me! My focus for this project was to design the mobile application interface with requirements that were discussed by the whole team collaboratively.</p>
                            <br>

                            <h3>Problem Space</h3>
                            <small>Frusturations in online shopping.</small>
                            <p>Shopping becomes super frusturating when you've scanned through 20 pages of an online store and you haven't come across a single product that tickles your interest. After that, the only thing that might be felt if regret, especially when you probabaly should've been getting other important work done in this time and online shopping was only suppose to be a quick source of happiness!</p>
                            <br>

                            <h3>Research</h3>
                            <small>Why is it frusturating?</small>
                            <p>With online shoppers within our project team itself, the research subjects were easy to obtain. We analyzed team members as they searched their favourite online stores with a "think aloud" approach. As a result, we were able to identify the pain points during the process:
                              <ul>
                                <li>On average, user was interested in a product after searching three pages of items.</li>
                                <li>User feel that majority of the products perform poorly at aiming to their unique personalities.</li>
                                <li>Time taken to find a product exceeds the time that the user allocated for their shopping visit.</li>
                                <li>Some users never even found a prodct that they liked during their recorded shopping trip.</li>
                              </ul>
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h3>Persona</h3>
                            <small>Creating a fake user to help us better understand who to design for.</small>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/iBuyer/persona.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <br>

                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            <small>A Store Just for the User.</small>
                            <p>We built a shopping application that performs deep learnig on each unique user. By collecting data from certain activities in the user's social media, Watson Analytics is able to analyze this data and determine the user's interests in a few different categories: Sports, Movies, Health, and Education. More specificly, each of these categories can be taken a step deeper by the user to see which of their activties in the past have impacted their persoanlity results. The result of this is an online store that collects catered products from multiple vendors into one place. This saves time from browsing through countless pages, and highly improves the success of the mobile shopping visit.</p>

Although difficult, I also feel that I was able to recover my strengths, and when I did, I wanted to asure myself that I train myself to never think doubtedly again. With the purpose to communicate the deeper values of fitness, I teamed with a friend who holds a similar mindset to establish a brand with a unique identity that strives for self-improvement amoung failures.</p>

                            <p>The aim of this project is to convince individuals that failure is not a bad thing. We set to accomplish this by constructing a brand that is chracterized by power, strength, will, and more importantly that any other trait, the brand is characterised by failures. As a beginning step, we thought about Batman; a hero characterised with strengths that were build by his many downfalls. This type of literature seen in Batman can be looked at as a role model for Evolv. </p>

                            <h3>Product Design</h3>
                            <p>Using blank t-shirt templates, we fombled with various tshirt designs on Photoshop. Eventually, we came up with something like this.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/evolv/productDesign.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <h3>Personalized Touch</h3>
                            <p>Since this brand focuses on a very deep level with the user, namely their personal performance and development, I felt that it was almost mandatory to make users feel significant. Every package holds a message personalized to the user.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/evolv/personalization.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <h3>Packaging Experience</h3>
                            <p>My biggest focus was to make every part of this brand memorable, and I acheived this by making the little things stand out. The first impression of a product is made during the unpackaging of the product. We felt that it was important to get this part right, so we designed product packaging that stood out from other fitness clothing retailors.</p>

                            <h3>Landing Page</h3>
                            <p>The online store for Evolv Fit Wear. One of the challenges I had with creating the design for this page was that we started off with selling only three items. As a result, following a standard online store design with a separate products page wouldn't work for us. So, I made the landing page itself more dominant with the content, and now the user can browse all items with minimal navigation steps. Also, a cool way we presented our products was by making each of them a segment of a journey. One product represents the beginning of a journey, the failure. Another product represents the training phase, where work is put in to correct the failures. And last but not least, our third product symbolizes success and evolution. The designs also resemble these aspects.</p>

                            <h3>My Role</h3>
                            <p>As the lead designer for daVinci, I was tasked to design the Next Generation Assortment Planning tool as the company transitioned from downloadable software to creating their software as a web application. Aside from the assortment planning, I also designed the company's ticketing system where customers can report issues with their product.</p>
                            <br>

                            <h3>The Client</h3>
                            <p>One of the big challenges I faced was that I had to design one application for various clients with different needs. In other words, I was not always given a clear set of user requirements. The user requirements could rather be considered a "dynamic variable" in this case. My approach to this challenge was to design the application as customizable as possible. The user is given a standard view, but has the option to customize parts of the application to suit their own process.</p>
                            <br>

                            <h3>Mockups/Prototypes</h3>
                            <p>I started by presenting a few different layout formats to the business team. Preference was given to the "Master-Detail" layout pattern. This pattern consists of a main area, the Master area, where an overview of all data items are viewed. To view deeper level information for a specific item in the Master area, a Detail panel presents details for the selected item. The Master-Detail is a great design pattern for the Merchandise Planning application because it provides an efficient way to navigate large data sets. At any given time, the screen space is only populated with the information that the user is interested in. As a result, scanability is improved, as well as the user's ability to focus on their areas of interest.</p>

                            <p>The flow chart describes the usage and outcomes for each functionality on the user interface. This planning application is very complex and entails a large number of functions. For such a case, a separate flow chart was created for each screen of the application. This allows cleaninless and better readibility of the context. Below is just one flowchart for the home screen of the application.</p>

                            <h3>Problem / Opportunity</h3>
                            <p>Yelp is commonly used for its review system to easily find new places to eat. However, trying a new restaurant is not something done on a daily basis, and thus the number of times users visit the app becomes limited. While users do not try new places every day, they do still need to eat and most of the time they have a few “go to” places which are close to their location. Since Yelp holds a valuable reputation for initiating good eating experiences, the app has the opportunity to increase stickiness by analyzing other user needs in the eating space to determine what services can be added that would be more frequently desired. After performing the assessments shown below, it is seen that a strong solution is to implement a feature that allows users to easily contact their friends when they are going to eat. This will be a popular feature because people use food as an opportunity to spend time with their friends, and as a way to socialize; that is, people do not like eating alone.</p>
                            <br>

                            <h3>Needs Assessment</h3>
                            <strong>Young adults (18-34)</strong>
                            <p>According to Yelp’s factsheet, 36% of users fall within the age range of 18-34, making this a good population to study when developing the new feature. (Due to time and budget constraints, other age groups were not investigated.) This age group consists of people who have strong social lives and also busy work schedules. User interviews expressed that grabbing a meal with friends is one of the most popular and desired activities for socializing. However, the problem they experience is that it is difficult to make successful plans with others when their unpredictable schedule finally allows them to eat.</p>
                            <br>

                            <h3>Feature Objectives & Solution</h3>
                            <small>To make the feature a viable solution for the provided problem space, it must succeed in achieving the target user’s ultimate goal. As well, it must be of a profitable use for the business.</small>
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Make it easy for users to eat with their friends</li>
                              <li>Make Yelp app more sticky by addressing a more frequent user need as identified</li>
                              <li>Integrate the feature seamlessly into the existing workflow</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>

                            <strong>Friends Finder</strong>
                            <p>The presented feature encourages and makes it easier for users to share a meal with friends on their Yelp list. Users are informed of the distance between them and nearby friends (max 5km away from the user), and the distance between a particular restaurant and nearby friends (max 5km away from the restaurant). Being able to see who is nearby at any given time creates a dynamic selection of friends to invite at the time of when the user him/herself is looking to get food. If a user is interested in eating with a selected friend, they could use Yelp’s already existing chat feature to start a conversation and meet up. Equally as importantly, users are greatly encouraged to visit the Yelp app much more often because this feature provides use for any time that a user needs to eat, not only when a user wants to eat some where new. In a scenario where a user orders food for 3/3 of their main meals a day, the user may open the app 3 times in a single day to see who they can invite. Leveraging the existing chat feature also makes the app sticky because users will keep going back to the app to check and reply to messages.

                              The flow shown below illustrates a scenario that would occur when a user wants to enjoy a meal at a chosen restaurant with a friend. This gives us a good idea of where the feature would integrate into the existing workflow.

                            <h3>Existing Market Research</h3>
                            <p>
                              A similar feature was released by the mobile application “Snapchat,” on June 20 2017, called “Snap Maps,” in attempt to drive greater engagement on the app. Snap Project Designer, Jack Brody, says about the feature that “This map isn't about where am I, it's about where are my friends and what are they up to?” Friends Finder for Yelp holds a similar objective, but tailored for the experience of enjoying great food. The graph below shows Snapchat having a 10% increase in popularity from Spring 2016 - Fall 2016. From Fall 2016 - Spring 2017, Snapchat’s popularity only increases by 4%. This is thought to have been caused by Instagram’s adoption of Snapchat’s popular “Stories” feature, likely causing a loss in retention for Snapchat. After releasing the “Snap Maps” feature in July 2017, the Snapchat’s popularity inclines again in Spring 2017 - Fall 2017 having an increase of 9%. Some users showed concern in using this feature because they feel unsafe sharing their location with other people at a high accuracy. Articles posted by Snapchat users outlined that they felt like they are being watched by other users, and by Snap Inc., all the time. Therefore, when implementing a location based feature, we need to create a good balance between offering feature effectiveness and showing too much location based detail.

                            <h3>Design</h3>
                            <p>
                              The relative location of friends is something that has a high rate of variability so the user must be able to access it easily to see updated information. Easily accessible features are better adopted, and as a result the business goal of making the app more sticky is better achieved. To ease learnability, I looked at common designs that users are familiar with; this makes it easy to learn the feature because users apply their experiences from similar occurrences in other apps. Chat bubbles are a common element that shows users who they are interacting with, and alerts them of new messages. Slight change to this design to clearly convey the metric as a unit of distance makes it an effective solution for for our design problem.

                              From the considered use cases of this feature, it proves to be useful at two areas inside the app:

                            <br>

                            <h3>Implementation</h3>
                            <p>
                              The proposed feature offers quick implementation for both design and development teams. The design of the existing app is impacted very slightly because the new feature fits into the current app. The flow of current user scenarios is not severely altered either. Front end development also requires minimal work because existing elements do not need to be restructured to account for the added feature. Also, the proposed feature leverages the already existing chat in the app, greatly reducing workload. Location sharing of up to a 5km radius needs to be implemented between users who are on each other’s Yelp friend list.

                              To request user information on Android, developers would have to add ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION and ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permissions to the AndroidManifest.yml file. To access the user’s location, the developer needs to use the LocationManager class.

                              To request user information on the iOS platform developers would have to request the Location Services permission. The location permission dialog will appear when the developer inherits CLLocationManagerDelegate and requests information from the CLLocationManager.

                            <h3>Challenges</h3>
                            <p>
                              Location settings create challenges for all apps because they consume a lot of processing power and are thus heavy on the device’s battery life. As a result, many users leave their location settings off and this can cause the location metric shown in “Friends Finder” to be outdated when a user looks at it. A potential solution is to refresh the location only while the user user is in the app. This is a reasonable compromise because if the person is not in the app, they probably are not looking to find a friend to eat with and thus do not need this feature to be active at such times.

                              The goal of “Friends Finder” is to further improve the eating experience of users by not only helping them find great places, but also great company to enjoy those places with. To evaluate how closely the proposed feature is meeting the defined objectives, the following metrics will be measured:
                              <ul>
                                <li>Increase in number of messages sent through Yelp chat.</li>
                                <li>Percentage turn over rate of users meeting up after having a chat in Yelp’s app.</li>
                                <li>Number of chat conversations initiated from a restaurant page.</li>
                              </ul>
                            </p>
                            <br>
